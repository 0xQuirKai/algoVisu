# AlgoVisu: The Algorithmic Visual Symphony 🎶✨

Welcome to **AlgoVisu**, where code turns into a visual masterpiece! This React-powered beast, built with Vite’s turbocharged engine, pure CSS flair, `shadcn/ui` elegance, and `framer-motion` magic, is your ticket to exploring algorithms like never before. Sorting, searching, graphing, DP wizardry—it’s all here, frero, wrapped in a sleek, animated package that slaps harder than a bass drop.

## What’s the Vibe? 🎨🔥

AlgoVisu isn’t just an app—it’s a cosmic stage for algorithms to shine. Picture this: bars swapping in a hypnotic dance, paths glowing through neon grids, combos spinning like a DJ’s turntable—all powered by React’s speed and Vite’s lightning-fast builds. With `shadcn/ui` bringing the polished UI and `framer-motion` dropping silky-smooth animations, this is where learning meets art. Ready to vibe with the code?

### Features That Hit Different 🚀
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort flex their moves—bars slide, scale, and glow with every comparison and swap.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Binary Search slices through arrays like a ninja, with pointers zooming to the target in a flash.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Dijkstra’s algorithm carves the shortest path through a grid—gradient searching blocks and pulsing endpoints steal the show.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) unfolds step-by-step, turning string puzzles into a visual harmony.
- **Combination Solver**: Crank out combos with a dope animation—numbers stack up like beats in a track.
- **Subset Problems**: Subset Sum and more, solved with flair—watch the possibilities light up the screen.

## Tech Stack That Slaps 🛠️
- **Vite**: Blazing-fast builds and dev server—zero lag, all swagger.
- **React**: The backbone of our dynamic, component-driven universe.
- **CSS**: Pure, hand-crafted styles—warm browns, beiges, and gradients for that cozy yet futuristic feel.
- **shadcn/ui**: Sleek, customizable components—buttons, selects, and alerts that look like they’re from 3025.
- **framer-motion**: Animations so smooth they’ll make you wanna replay every sort and search.
