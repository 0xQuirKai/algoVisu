AlgoVisu is a web application built with Vite, React, and CSS to visualize algorithms. It uses `shadcn/ui` for components and `framer-motion` for animations. The app includes sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, graph algorithms, dynamic programming problems like Longest Common Subsequence (LCS), a combination solver, and subset problems.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Visualize Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort with animated bars.
- **Searching Algorithms**: See Binary Search find targets in an array.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Watch Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm find the shortest path on a grid.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Explore Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) and other DP solutions.
- **Combination Solver**: Generate combinations with step-by-step visuals.
- **Subset Problems**: Solve subset sum and similar problems with clear animations.

## Tech Stack

- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server.
- **React**: JavaScript library for building the interface.
- **CSS**: Custom styles for the design.
- **shadcn/ui**: Reusable UI components.
- **framer-motion**: Library for animations.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
